Agro-Technology is a web-based platform connecting farmers and consumers. It enables farmers to list products, reach buyers directly, and get fair pricing, while consumers access fresh produce easily. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, it promotes transparency and sustainability in agriculture.
