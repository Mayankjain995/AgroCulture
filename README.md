# AgroCulture
Agro-Technology is a web-based platform connecting farmers and consumers. It enables farmers to list products, reach buyers directly, and get fair pricing, while consumers access fresh produce easily. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, it promotes transparency and sustainability in agriculture.

This project was developed as part of the academic mini-project at **Visveswaraya Technological University, CPGS, Mysuru**.
